        This means that you are waiting for your next pixel. When you place a
        pixel, there is a cooldown for when you can place the next one. Over
        time, you can gain up to 6 "stacked" pixels to place at once.

      </dt>
      <dd>
        This is by design. It is better to place a pixel as soon as you get one.
        Pixel "stacking" is meant to give you a bump if you go AFK for a bit. It
        takes around 40 minutes to get a full 6/6 pixels, but it only takes
        around 3 minutes to place 6 pixels if you place them as soon as
        possible.

      <dd>
        A template is an image link that is posted in the template textbox in
        the settings panel so you can place over it on the canvas. You may use a
        regular image link to your pixel art, but many people use 3rd party
        tools like
        <a href="https://charity.pxls.space" target="_blank">Charity</a> or
        <a href="https://discord.gg/5MVDCq53vC" target="blank">Clueless</a> to
        turn pixel art into a fancier link. If you need to make pixel art
        yourself, you can use
        <a href="https://www.piskelapp.com/p/create" target="_blank">Piskel</a>
        to create art to put into Charity or Clueless.
